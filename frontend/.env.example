# Frontend environment variables

# Base URL for the backend API
# IMPORTANT:
#   - This value is used in the browser (client-side).
#   - The browser can only reach the backend through your machine's exposed ports.
#
# In local development (running `pnpm dev` or Docker):
#   http://localhost:8000/api
#
# NOTE:
# Do NOT set this to "http://backend:8000/api".
# That only works between containers inside Docker,
# not from your browser or phone.
